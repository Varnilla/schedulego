# ScheduLEGO 🐵⏰

Welcome to ScheduLEGO repository! A Whatsapp NodeJS bot for a P5 School project!

## What Is It ❓

**ScheduLEGO** is a bot thats capable of reminding you about stuff, mostly about school. here, for example: you have a math exam in three days! but you're afraid you'll forget about it later, BUT DON'T WORRY! **ScheduLEGO** comes in clutch! just run the command and you'll be notified later on. And the rest of the feature is just reminds you what are tommorow's subject is going to be, and uhh.. yeah.. thats probably much it, i can't think of any more, feel free to suggest me a feature though.
